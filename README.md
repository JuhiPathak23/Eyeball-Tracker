# Eyeball-Tracker
The Eyeball Tracking Application is a computer vision project implemented using OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) in Python. The application detects faces and eyes in both live webcam streams and static images, providing visual feedback by drawing rectangles around detected eyes and placing red dots at the centers of the eyes.
